20001#Position Properties|MainHeading
200011#The position properties are: left, right, top, bottom, centerX, and centerY. For example:|Paragraph

200013#Align Property|MainHeading
200011#The align property can be useful when first drawing a shape and aligning it in different ways. For example:|Paragraph
230013#|InlineContainer
200011#There are 9 legal values for align -- the same as the start values for a gradient. The previous example shows 5 of these 9 legal values. Here we see the other 4 ('left', 'top', 'right', and 'bottom'):|Paragraph
230014#|InlineContainer
200011#Note: unlike other properties, we can only use align when we first create a shape. So this is an error:|Paragraph

200016#Changing Properties|MainHeading
200011#Now that we know about all these shape properties, we will want to know how we can change them. We can use += to add to a property, and -= to subtract from it, like so:|Paragraph
230018#|InlineContainer
200011#The previous example used += and -=. We can also use *= to multiply by a value, and /= to divide by a value.|Paragraph
