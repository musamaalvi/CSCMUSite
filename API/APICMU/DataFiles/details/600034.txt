600011#Vertical motion is basically the same as horizontal motion, only:|Paragraph
600011#-   use dy instead of dx|Paragraph
600011#-   use top instead of left|Paragraph
600011#-   use bottom instead of right|Paragraph
600011#-   use centerY instead of centerX|Paragraph
600011#That's it. For example, here is the previous example changed to work vertically:|Paragraph

60004#Diagonal Motion|MainHeading
600011#To move on diagonals, we move horizontally and vertically. Also, we do not have to make dx the same as dy -- as these values differ, we can make shapes move along different diagonals. Let's see the previous example one more time, but with diagonal motion:|Paragraph

60006#Smooth Motion|MainHeading
600011#The larger dx is, the faster the shape moves. For example, here is a really large dx:|Paragraph

600011#Run the code. See how the circle definitely is moving very fast but its motion is not smooth. By taking steps of 100 pixels at a time, the motion is too choppy. Instead of making dx large, we can speed up the circle by increasing app.stepsPerSecond. Let's try it:|Paragraph
600011#Instead of making dx larger, we can speed up the circle by changing app.stepsPerSecond. This is the number of times onStep is called each second. We can speed up the app by increasing app.stepsPerSecond. Let's try it:|Paragraph

600011#Run the code. With a dx of 1, it sure is smooth! But even with an app.stepsPerSecond of 40, it still is slow. We can try increasing app.stepsPerSecond even more, but there is a limit to how fast the app can run, no matter how large app.stepsPerSecond is. his limit depends on your computer -- a faster computer has a higher limit, but all computers have a limit.|Paragraph

600011#Run the code. It's a bit faster, but not fast enough. And app.stepsPerSecond is 1000. One thousand! Why isn't it faster? Because there is a limit to how fast the app can run, no matter how large app.stepsPerSecond is. This limit depends on your computer -- a faster computer has a higher limit. But all computers have some limit, and it's not very high. You can safely use app.stepsPerSecond up to about 40. Even that will be too high for some computers.|Paragraph
600011#So what should we do? The answer is to balance these two approaches. Set dx to be larger, but not too large, or else movement will not be smooth. And set app.stepsPerSecond to be larger, but not too large, or the computer will not be able to keep up. Here is an example:|Paragraph

60007#More Patterns of Motion|MainHeading
600011#These are just a few patterns of motion. Here are some others:|Paragraph
600011#jumping and falling (projectile motion, gravity)|Paragraph
600011#slowing and stopping (easing with friction, deceleration)|Paragraph
600011#directional motion (moving towards a point or at a given angle)|Paragraph
600011#circular motion|Paragraph
600011#and on and on!|Paragraph
600011#There sure are a lot of kinds of motion! For now, let's have fun with what we just learned.|Paragraph
