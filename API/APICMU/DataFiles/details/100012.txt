100011#To change a shape's color, use the optional fill argument, like so::|Paragraph
100012# Rect(50, 50, 100, 100, fill='green')|InlineContainer
100011#Run the code, and you should see a green rectangle. Great! Now edit the code to try to make the rectangle orange. Did it work? When using fill, here are some rules to follow: Include fill after the required arguments -- left, top, width, and height. Always place an equals sign (=) before the color name. Put quotes around the color name. You can use either single quotes, like 'blue', or double quotes, like "blue". As we saw before, if any of these rules are not right, you have a syntax error and the code will not run until you fix the error|Paragraph

10001#Drawing Order|MainHeading
100011#We can now see that the order in which we draw shapes matters. Each new shape is drawn on top of all the previous shapes. For example:|Paragraph
100011# Rect(0, 0, 100, 100, fill='orange') |InlineContainer
123123# Look carefully at the canvas. See how the lime rectangle is in front of, or on top of, the orange rectangle. Ok, now let's try it the other way: |Paragraph

10001#Borders|MainHeading
100011#Rectangles may have an optional border, like so::|Paragraph
100011# Rect(50, 50, 100, 100, fill='yellow', border='blue') |InlineContainer
123123# Run the code to see a yellow rectangle with a thin blue border around it. Then, edit the code to get a blue rectangle with a yellow frame around it. Success? By default, borders are 2 pixels wide. You can change that with borderWidth: |Paragraph
100011# Rect(50, 50, 100, 100, fill='yellow', border='blue', borderWidth=12) |InlineContainer

10001#Empty Fills|MainHeading
100011#We can draw a rectangle with only a border color, and without any fill color. To do this, set the fill to None, like so:|Paragraph
100011# Rect(50, 50, 100, 100, fill=None, border='blue', borderWidth=6) |InlineContainer
100011#This can become clearer if we include another rectangle:|Paragraph
