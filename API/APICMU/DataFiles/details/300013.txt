10001#Using if-else|MainHeading
100011#We use if to run code only when some condition is true. When we use if, we can also use else to run some other code when that condition is false. For example: |Paragraph

100011#Else and Otherwise:
100011#In coding, using else is similar to how we use "otherwise" in everyday language. You might say: "if it's sunny, wear sunglasses, otherwise bring an umbrella". That could translate into Python as something like this:if (isSunny == True):wear('sunglasses')else:bring('umbrella')|PinkParagraph

10001#Multiple if's|MainHeading
100011#Sometimes we may want to use more than one if statement. For example, say we want to draw cyan circles when the user clicks on the left, and we also wish to draw black stars when they click on the top. For this, we will use two if's, like so:|Paragraph
350004#Label('Multiple ifs demo #1', 200, 20, size=20, bold=True)|InlineContainer
340004#mcq|CheckPoint
100011#Let's try that example again, only now let's change that second if into an else:|Paragraph
350005#Label('Multiple ifs demo #2', 200, 20, size=20, bold=True)|InlineContainer
