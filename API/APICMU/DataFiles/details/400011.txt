40001#Using 'else'|MainHeading
400011#Let's start with this example for review:|Paragraph
410011#|InlineContainer
400011#Run the code and see how you get cyan circles on the left, and gold circles on the right. Look closely at line 8 (the else statement). We use else after an if to run code if the previous test was False. In this example, since the previous if tested if the click was on the left, the else tests if the click was on the right.|Paragraph
420001#Else and Otherwise: In coding, using else is similar to how we use "otherwise" in everyday language. You might say: "if it's sunny, wear sunglasses, otherwise bring an umbrella". That could translate into Python as something like this:|PinkParagraph
400012#if (isSunny == True):    wear('sunglasses')   else:    bring('umbrella')|Box
end
40002#Using "elif"|MainHeading
400011#Right after we use if, we can use elif to add another test that will only be tested if the first test was False. For example:|Paragraph
410012#|InlineContainer
400011#Run the code and see how you get cyan circles on the left, black rings in the middle, and gold circles on the right. Look closely at line 9 (the elif statement). This test only happens if the first test is False. So we can only get black rings if we do not get cyan circles.|Paragraph

40003#Using more than one "elif"|MainHeading
400031#We can use as many elif's as we need. Each elif is only tested if none of the previous tests was True. For example:|Paragraph

40003#Another example|MainHeading
400031#Let's look at one more example:|Paragraph

400011#Run the code, and click in each of the four squares and see what happens.|Paragraph
420001#Why do we only get black rings in the top-right and not in the top-left?|The if tests if the click is on the left, and we can only get to the elif if that test was False, so only if the click was on the right. Then the elif tests if the click is on the top, so that test only passes if the click is both on the right and on the top.|Alert
