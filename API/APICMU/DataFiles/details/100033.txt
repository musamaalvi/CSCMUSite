10001#Labels|MainHeading
100011#We use a label to draw text, like so:|Paragraph
130031#|InlineContainer
100011#This draws the value 'hello' centered at (200, 200). In general, Label takes 3 arguments -- the value to draw, and the (x,y) center where to draw it.|Paragraph
100011#For now, we will only use label values that are strings. String values are in quotes ('single-quotes' or "double-quotes"), just like the color names we've been using. Be sure to include quotes, or you will get a syntax error!|Paragraph
end
10002#Size|MainHeading

10004#Fonts|MainHeading
100011#We can change the font, like so:|Paragraph
130035#|InlineContainer
100011#Run that code and look carefully at the canvas to see that 'arial' and 'sans' are the same font, and 'courier' and 'monospace' are also the same font. Finally, the default font does not have to be arial, but it often is.|Paragraph
100021#Note: our system is under development, and for now it only supports 2 fonts -- arial and courier. We plan to add more fonts soon!|PinkParagraph
