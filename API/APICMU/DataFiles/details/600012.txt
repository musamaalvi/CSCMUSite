60001#Position Properties|MainHeading
600011#First, let's review this example from the previous notes:|Paragraph
600021#Rect(10, 20, 30, 40)|InlineContainer
600011#We see that when we change the centerX and centerY of the group, this changes the positions of every shape in the group. This is true of all the position properties of a group. For example, let's change the example so it sets the group's right edge to the mouse, like so:|Paragraph
600021#Rect(10, 20, 30, 40)|InlineContainer
600121#|CheckPoint
end
60002#Non-position Properties|MainHeading
600011#In addition to position properties like centerX and right, we can also use groups to set the non-position properties opacity, fill, width, and height. We can see that in the following code:|Paragraph
600021#Rect(10, 20, 30, 40)|InlineContainer
end
60003#Child-specific Properties|MainHeading
620001#When we add a shape to a group, we say that the shape is a child of the group, and the group is the parent of the shape. Thus, the children of a group are all the shapes that have been added to that group.||Alert
600011#When we change a property of a group, it changes that property for all of its children that use that property. What if we only want to change one child? For example, let's only change the inner star's points in the previous example.|Paragraph
600011#To do this, we need to assign that star to a variable. We do this before we add the star to the group. Then we use that variable to add the star to the group, like so:|Paragraph
600122#|CheckPoint
