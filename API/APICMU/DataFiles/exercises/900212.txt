# (1) Select the first test case.
# (2) Notice that there are 2 circled polygons.
# (3) Now, select the second test case.
# (4) Notice that there are now three circled polygons.
# (5) Also, notice that the colors changed from midnight blue to shades of green.
# (6) Finally, notice that the number of points on the polygons also changed.
# That's it, let's code!

# Write the function drawCircledPolygon(...) that takes five parameters.
# Run test cases and use the Inspector to find more details.

def drawCircledPolygon(centerX, centerY, circleColor, numberOfSides, polyColor):
