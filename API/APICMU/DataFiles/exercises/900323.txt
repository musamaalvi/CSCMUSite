# (1) Click on the sky.
# (2) Notice how the sun moves to the location of your click and the moon
#     changes locations to reflect the sun.
# (3) Now click below the sky (in the dark part of the canvas).
# (4) The sun doesn't move because you didn't click in the sky!
# That's it, let's code!
