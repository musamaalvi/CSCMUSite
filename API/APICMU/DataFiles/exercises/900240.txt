# (1) Select the test case that makes one call to drawEye.
# (2) One eye appears on the alien, at the location specified by the first two
#     arguments to drawEye.
# (3) Now, select the test case that has three calls to drawEye. There are now
#     three eyes!
# (4) Notice that the second two arguments correspond to the size of the eye
#     and the pupil: The bigger those values are, the bigger that eye is.
# That's it, letâ€™s code!
