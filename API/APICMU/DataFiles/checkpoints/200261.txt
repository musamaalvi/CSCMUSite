In the previous example, what happens if you press the mouse and immediately release it (without moving it)? Try it first before answering.
We get two circles -- a navy circle drawn directly over a gold circle.
There is no way to tell if we have one or two circles.
The code crashes if we do that.
We get only one circle -- the gold circle becomes navy.
