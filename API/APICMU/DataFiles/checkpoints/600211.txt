What happens in the previous example if we used triangle.hitsShape(g) instead of g.hitsShape(triangle)? (Try it first!)
The code runs but the shapes never change color.
Nothing changes.
The code runs at first, but it crashes when the triangle hits any shape in the group.
The code will not run at all.
