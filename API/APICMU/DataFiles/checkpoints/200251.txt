How can we be sure that there are 2 circles after we click the mouse in the previous example?
Both a red and a blue circle are clearly visible.
The Inspector shows one point with two colors, red and blue, even though we can only see blue.
The circle is purple, because it combines blue and red.
We cannot. There is no way to tell.
