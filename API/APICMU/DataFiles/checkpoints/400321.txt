What is the main reason that addPoint is a method and not a function?
There is no reason for this.
addPoint will run faster as a method instead of a function.
Calling addPoint is easier if it is a method instead of a function.
addPoint only makes sense for polygons, and not other shapes, and unlike functions, methods can be restricted to just some shapes and not others.
