In the previous example, nothing changes if we use range(40, 440, 80) instead of range(40, 361, 80). Why?
440 is still excluded, so the last pass of the loop sets centerX to 360.
It is an error to have a value greater than the size of the canvas.
Another circle is added, but it is drawn off screen so we can't see it.
We can never loop more than 5 times.
