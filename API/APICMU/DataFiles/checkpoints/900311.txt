In the previous example, what happens if we use 0 instead of 100 -- that is, if we loop while (total.value < 0)? Try it first!
The code runs, but the loop only runs once, no matter what number we input.
Nothing changes -- the code works the same either way.
The code will not run at all.
The body of loop never runs, because toal.value is never negative.
