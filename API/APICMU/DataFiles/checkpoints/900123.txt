In the previous example, what happens if we enter a word with all uppercase letters? Try it first!
We get an error.
All the letters are drawn in uppercase.
All the letters in the alphabet are drawn in red.
Nothing changes; the letters in the alphabet tha are in the word are still drawn in green.
