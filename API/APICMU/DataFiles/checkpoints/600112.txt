What is wrong with this code: g = Group(         Circle(200, 200, 50, fill=None, border='black', borderWidth=5)        Star(200, 200, 50, 5, fill=None, border='black', borderWidth=5)    )
It is missing a comma after the circle.
It is missing a closing right-parenthesis after all the shapes.
Nothing is wrong.
It is missing a comma after the star.
