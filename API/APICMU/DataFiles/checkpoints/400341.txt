How can s.contains(x,y) be True yet s.hits(x,y) be False?
This generally happens if (x,y) is on the border of s.
This can never happen.
This generally happens if (x,y) is inside the shape s, but s has no fill and does not draw anything at the point (x,y).
This generally happens if (x,y) is not on the border of s.
