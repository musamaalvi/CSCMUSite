In the previous example, what would happen if we changed c.dx = 5 to instead be c.dx = -5? (Try it first!)
The circle would move left, and stop at the left edge of the screen.
The circle would move left, and continue off the screen, because we are only checking if it moves off the right edge.
The code would not run at all.
Nothing would change.
