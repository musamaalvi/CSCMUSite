In the previous example, what if we added onMousePress() -- would that function be called if we pressed the mouse after we pressed 's' to stop the app? (Try it first!)
There is no way to be sure about this.
No -- no event functions are called after app.stop() is called.
Yes -- app.stop() stops key events but not mouse events.
