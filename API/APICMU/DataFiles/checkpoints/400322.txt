In the previous example, what happens if we forget to use the parentheses in our call to s.toFront? That is, what if we call s.toFront instead of s.toFront()? (Try it first!)
The code will not run due to a syntax error.
Nothing changes -- the code runs the same as before.
The code runs, but nothing happens when we press 'f' (the star does not move to the front).
The code runs but it crashes when we press 'f' and try to call toFront.
