In the previous example, what happens if we did not draw the Labels? (Try it first!)
The circle can change to blue or gold, but there's no way to make it black again.
The circle no longer changes colors.
The code still works the same way, but the user would have no idea which keys to press to make it work.
Nothing changes.
