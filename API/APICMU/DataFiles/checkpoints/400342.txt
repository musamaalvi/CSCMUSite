In the previous example, what happens if we call s.hitsShape(dot) instead of dot.hitsShape(s)? (Try it first!)
The code runs, but the star moves instead of the dot.
The code will not run due to a syntax error.
nothing changes, these do the same thing.
The code runs, but it crashes when we try to call hitsShape.
