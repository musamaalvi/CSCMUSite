Since we can often solve the same problem using multiple conditionals, or compound conditionals, or nested conditionals, how do we know which of these to use for a given problem?
Always use compound conditionals.
Always use nested conditionals.
Always use multiple conditionals.
Use whatever seems clearest to you for that particular problem.
