In the previous example, say that on line 5 instead of setting c.centerY to y, we set it to 0. What happens then when we click the mouse? Hint: try it out first!
The circle moves horizontally to the x position of the click, but vertically it stays at the top of the canvas.
The code no longer runs at all.
Nothing changes. The circle moves to the position of the mouse click.
The circle always stays in the center of the canvas.
