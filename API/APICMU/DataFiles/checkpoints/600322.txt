In the previous example, we set c.dx to 0 to make the circle c stand still. What is another way we can write this code so that c stands still sometimes and moves other times?
Do not use onKeyPress at all.
Do not call onStep when the circle should stand still.
Use c.standingStill, which we set to True when we want c to stand still, and then in onStep we only move c if c.standingStill is False.
There is no other way to do this.
